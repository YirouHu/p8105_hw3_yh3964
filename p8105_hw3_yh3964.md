Load packages and datasets

``` r

``` r
library(dplyr)
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart") 
```

Set the size of plots

``` r
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = 0.6,
  out.width = "90%"
)
```

Change legend position to bottom and remove the frame

``` r
theme_set(theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom")) 
```

We change continuous and discrete variables with “viridis” for color and
fill

``` r
options(
  ggplot2.continuous.colour = "viridis",
  ggplot2.continuous.fill = "viridis"
)

scale_colour_discrete = scale_colour_viridis_d
scale_fill_discrete = scale_fill_viridis_d
```

# Problem 1

The goal is to do some exploration of this dataset. To that end, write a
short description of the dataset, noting the size and structure of the
data, describing some key variables, and giving illstrative examples of
observations. Then, do or answer the following (commenting on the
results of each)

## How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered from?

``` r
aisles_number_df = 
  instacart |>
  group_by(aisle) |>
  summarize(count_aisle = n()) |>
  mutate(aisle_rank = rank(desc(count_aisle))) |>
  arrange(aisle_rank)
```

Dataset description:

The whole dataset provides detailed information on each product that
customers ordered, including the product name, department, and aisle, as
well as the information about the time they make this order, such as
order_dow and order_hour_of_day. Additionally, it includes informaiton
about whether the product was reordered, the order number, and the
number of days since the prior order. The product id, aisle id and the
order they belonged to are also provided.

There are 134 aisles and fresh vegetables is the aisle with the most
items ordered from.

## Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle, limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

``` r
instacart |>
  group_by(aisle) |>
  summarize(count_aisle = n()) |>
  arrange(count_aisle) |>
  filter(count_aisle > 10000) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = count_aisle, y = reorder(aisle, -count_aisle))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "blue", alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(                                             
    title = "Number of Items Ordered in Each Aisle",
    x = "Number of Items Ordered",
    y = "Aisle"
  ) 
```

Plot description:

This bar chart shows the number of items ordered from each aisle. It’s
clear that “fresh vegetables” and “fresh fruits” are the most popular,
with the highest order counts. Other top sellers include “packaged
vegetables and fruits,” “yogurt,” and “packaged cheese.” Less ordered
items come from aisles like “butter” and “oils vinegars,” yet they still
exceed 10,000 orders. This chart helps identify which products are in
highest demand.

## Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered in your table.

``` r
popular_items_df = 
  instacart |>
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) |>
  group_by(aisle, product_name) |>
  summarise(number_of_time = n()) |>
  mutate(rank_of_time = rank(desc(number_of_time))) |>
  arrange(rank_of_time) |>
  filter(rank_of_time == c(1,2,3)) |>
  arrange(desc(number_of_time)) 
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'aisle'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

    ## Warning: There were 3 warnings in `filter()`.
    ## The first warning was:
    ## ℹ In argument: `rank_of_time == c(1, 2, 3)`.
    ## ℹ In group 1: `aisle = "baking ingredients"`.
    ## Caused by warning in `rank_of_time == c(1, 2, 3)`:
    ## ! longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length
    ## ℹ Run `dplyr::last_dplyr_warnings()` to see the 2 remaining warnings.

``` r
popular_items_df |>
  knitr::kable(col.names = c("Aisle", "Product Name", "Number of times ordered", "Rank"))
```

| Aisle | Product Name | Number of times ordered | Rank |
|:---|:---|---:|---:|
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach | 9784 | 1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries | 5546 | 2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries | 4966 | 3 |
| baking ingredients | Light Brown Sugar | 499 | 1 |
| baking ingredients | Pure Baking Soda | 387 | 2 |
| baking ingredients | Cane Sugar | 336 | 3 |
| dog food care | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats | 30 | 1 |
| dog food care | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe | 28 | 2 |
| dog food care | Small Dog Biscuits | 26 | 3 |

## Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week; format this table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).

``` r
instacart |>
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) |>
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) |>
  summarise(mean_order_hour_of_day = mean(order_hour_of_day)) |>
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow,
    values_from = mean_order_hour_of_day
  ) |>
  knitr::kable() 
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'product_name'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

| product_name     |        0 |        1 |        2 |        3 |        4 |        5 |        6 |
|:-----------------|---------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77419 | 14.31579 | 15.38095 | 15.31818 | 15.21739 | 12.26316 | 13.83333 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44118 | 11.36000 | 11.70213 | 14.25000 | 11.55172 | 12.78431 | 11.93750 |

The table shows the average ordering hours for “Pink Lady Apples” and
“Coffee Ice Cream” by day of the week. “Coffee Ice Cream” orders peak
mid-week, especially on Wednesdays around 15 hours. “Pink Lady Apples”
are most ordered on Thursdays around 14 hours.

# Problem 2

This Problem uses the Zillow datasets introduced in Homework 2.

We first do data cleaning about zip code datasets.

``` r
zip_codes_df = 
  read_csv("zillow_data/Zip Codes.csv") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  select(-state_fips, -file_date) |> 
  distinct(zip_code, .keep_all = TRUE)
```

    ## Rows: 322 Columns: 7
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (4): County, County Code, File Date, Neighborhood
    ## dbl (3): State FIPS, County FIPS, ZipCode
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

Next, we do data cleaning on zillow rent price dataset.

``` r
zillow_rent_df = 
  read_csv("zillow_data/Zip_zori_uc_sfrcondomfr_sm_month_NYC.csv") |>
  pivot_longer(
    cols = "2015-01-31":"2024-08-31",
    names_to = "Date",
    values_to = "Zori"
  ) |> 
  rename(
     zip_code = "RegionName",
     region_id = "RegionID",
     size_rank = "SizeRank",
     state = "State",
     county_name = "CountyName"
  ) |>
  select(zip_code, -RegionType, -StateName, -City, -Metro, everything()) |>
  drop_na(Zori)
```

    ## Rows: 149 Columns: 125
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr   (6): RegionType, StateName, State, City, Metro, CountyName
    ## dbl (119): RegionID, SizeRank, RegionName, 2015-01-31, 2015-02-28, 2015-03-3...
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

We merge them together

``` r
zip_zillow_merge_df = left_join(zillow_rent_df, zip_codes_df, by = "zip_code")
```

## There are 116 months between January 2015 and August 2024. How many ZIP codes are observed 116 times? How many are observed fewer than 10 times? Why are some ZIP codes are observed rarely and others observed in each month?

Answer:

- There are 48 ZIP codes observed 116 times.
- There are 26 ZIP codes observed fewer than 10 times.
- The reason for ZIP codes are observed rarely and other are observed in
  each month is due to the data availability and collection ability of
  Zillow.
- Furthermore, some ZIP codes may contain industrial zones, commercial
  areas, parks, or other non-residential regions, where typical rental
  data is unavailable.
- Moreover, there exists missing ZIP codes correspond to areas with
  smaller populations or fewer rental units. Zillow may not have enough
  transactions to generate reliable rental price estimates.
