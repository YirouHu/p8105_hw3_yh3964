Load packages and datasets

``` r
library(patchwork)
library(tidyverse)
```

``` r
library(dplyr)
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart") 
```

Set the size of plots

``` r
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = 0.6,
  out.width = "90%"
)
```

Change legend position to bottom and remove the frame

``` r
theme_set(theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom")) 
```

We change continuous and discrete variables with “viridis” for color and
fill

``` r
options(
  ggplot2.continuous.colour = "viridis",
  ggplot2.continuous.fill = "viridis"
)

scale_colour_discrete = scale_colour_viridis_d
scale_fill_discrete = scale_fill_viridis_d
```

# Problem 1

The goal is to do some exploration of this dataset. To that end, write a
short description of the dataset, noting the size and structure of the
data, describing some key variables, and giving illstrative examples of
observations. Then, do or answer the following (commenting on the
results of each)

## How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered from?

``` r
aisles_number_df = 
  instacart |>
  group_by(aisle) |>
  summarize(count_aisle = n()) |>
  mutate(aisle_rank = rank(desc(count_aisle))) |>
  arrange(aisle_rank)
```

Dataset description:

The whole dataset provides detailed information on each product that
customers ordered, including the product name, department, and aisle, as
well as the information about the time they make this order, such as
order_dow and order_hour_of_day. Additionally, it includes informaiton
about whether the product was reordered, the order number, and the
number of days since the prior order. The product id, aisle id and the
order they belonged to are also provided.

There are 134 aisles and fresh vegetables is the aisle with the most
items ordered from.

## Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle, limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

``` r
instacart |>
  group_by(aisle) |>
  summarize(count_aisle = n()) |>
  arrange(count_aisle) |>
  filter(count_aisle > 10000) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = count_aisle, y = reorder(aisle, -count_aisle))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "blue", alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(                                             
    title = "Number of Items Ordered in Each Aisle",
    x = "Number of Items Ordered",
    y = "Aisle"
  ) 
```

Plot description:

This bar chart shows the number of items ordered from each aisle. It’s
clear that “fresh vegetables” and “fresh fruits” are the most popular,
with the highest order counts. Other top sellers include “packaged
vegetables and fruits,” “yogurt,” and “packaged cheese.” Less ordered
items come from aisles like “butter” and “oils vinegars,” yet they still
exceed 10,000 orders. This chart helps identify which products are in
highest demand.
